## Front End Package Managers
+ [NPM](https://docs.npmjs.com/) - The world’s largest software registry. Open source developers from every continent use npm to share and borrow packages, and many organizations use npm to manage private development as well. Relied upon by more than 11 million developers worldwide, npm is committed to making JavaScript development elegant, productive, and safe
+ [Yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs) - Yarn caches every package it downloads so it never needs to download it again. It also parallelizes operations to maximize resource utilization so install times are faster than ever
+ [NPM v Yarn | StackShare](https://stackshare.io/stackups/npm-vs-yarn) - Developers are usually caught in a dilemma when choosing between package managers to use in building and managing project dependencies. Two popular package managers in the ecosystem are NPM (Node package manager) and Yarn (package manager created by Facebook)

## Python

Redis has built-in replication, Lua scripting, LRU eviction, transactions and different levels of on-disk persistence, and provides high availability via Redis Sentinel and automatic partitioning with Redis Cluster
+ [Memcached](https://github.com/memcached/memcached/wiki) - A high-performance, distributed memory object caching system, generic in nature, but originally intended for use in speeding up dynamic web applications by alleviating database load. You can think of it as a short-term memory for your applications.

## Scala
